# Bham's Home Button
A Home Button for Foundry VTT!

# Configuration & Usage
Simply head over to the module config and set the desired scene. 
Clicking the button will take the user to the set scene, otherwise, the button returns the user to the currently active scene. **This means Gamemasters and Players may move independently across scenes. Beware.**
